# Soxi::Wrapper

This very simple wrapper has been abandonned. We haven't used it in years.

We have upgraded this to ensure we don't publish unsafe code (based on work by @tomekr on https://github.com/ArnsboMedia/soxi-wrapper/pull/1)

## Installation

If you must:

    gem 'soxi-wrapper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install soxi-wrapper

## Contributing

We have abandonned this.
